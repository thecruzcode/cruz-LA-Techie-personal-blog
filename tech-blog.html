          Whether it's the Sunset Strip, which served as a home, office and bar
          to some of the most famous musicians of all time, or the vibrant LGBTQ
          community that's as ingrained in the community as Rock and Roll, West
          Hollywood seems to add another dimension to its identity every couple
          of years. Over the past decade, tech startups have moved in, eschewing
          the more established seaside communities of "Silicon Beach" for WeHo's
          history, culture and proximity to the entertainment industry. Built In
          LA spoke with Jeff Pion, Michelle Esquivel and Shay Bolton of
          commercial real estate services company CBRE to understand a little
          bit about what West Hollywood means to Los Angeles, and what an influx
          of up-starts might mean for the future of the area.

          West Hollywood is home to a number of cultural landmarks. The House of
          Blues (though it closed in 2015), Whisky a Go Go, The Troubadour, The
          Roxy Theatre and Viper Room all are located on Sunset, while
          architectural beauties such as the Pacific Design Center, La Fontaine
          Building and 9200 Sunset add to the diversity. The LGBTQ community in
          West Hollywood is known as one of the most vibrant communities of its
          kind in the world. In 1967, prior to the Stonewall riots in New York
          City, a group called PRIDE (Personal Rights in Defense and Education)
          met every week at a bar in West Hollywood called the Hub. PRIDE helped
          organize protests after a violent police raid on the Black Cat Tavern
          in Silver Lake, two years before the Stonewall riots.

          Today, the area — occasionally dubbed "Gay Camelot" — is home to one
          of the biggest Pride festivals in the world, a yearly AIDS Walk and
          number of local LGBTQ-focused nonprofits. Dating app Grindr, which has
          become one of the most unifying voices in the global gay community,
          has also set up shop in the neighborhood with its global headquarters.

          Situated at the southern base of the Hollywood Hills, West Hollywood
          is neighbored by the San Fernando Valley to the north, Hollywood to
          its east and West Los Angeles (Century City, Westwood, Brentwood and
          Culver City) to its south and west. The main freeways in the area are
          the 405, which runs west of West Hollywood, and the 101, which runs to
          its east.
