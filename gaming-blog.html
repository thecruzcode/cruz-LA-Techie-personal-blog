          How would you feel if you could change your reality and create a whole
          new one? A reality which is maybe based in space with asteroids
          attacking a spaceship! Or maybe a reality-based in the ocean where you
          try to fight pirates! Well, creating a new reality is not possible in
          the real world but it is definitely possible in the world of Game
          Development. And the popularity of Game Development is only
          increasing. This can be because video games are becoming more and more
          popular and people now want to not only participate in these worlds
          but also create them!!!
        </p>

        <p class="blog-paragraph-blocks">
          So if you want to know How to Get Started with Game Development, this
          article is perfect for you as it will teach you the basics and provide
          you with various resources that will take you further on your journey.
          Let’s begin with understanding what is Game Development and then move
          on to more complex topics.

          Simply speaking, Game Development is the overall process of creating a
          video game. And if you thought that making a video game is as easy as
          playing one, well it’s not!!! There are many components while creating
          a game such as Story, Characters, Audio, Art, Lighting, etc. that
          eventually merge together to create a whole new world in a video
          game!!! This process of Game Development for commercial games is
          funded by a publisher (a rich company!) but independent video games
          are comparatively cheaper and smaller so they can be funded by
          individuals also (That can be you!).

          IThere are many people who assume that if they are good Game Players
          then they will definitely be good in Game Development. Well, don’t
          make that mistake!!! If you are a good Game Player then you have some
          advantage because you already know something about game stories,
          players, levels etc. But that’s it! Actually Game Playing and Game
          Development are very different fields and the skills you acquire in
          the former will not necessarily help you in the latter. For example:
          If you love movies, that doesn’t necessarily mean you will be a good
          movie director!!! So get into Game Development only if you are
          passionate about game programming and really want to develop a game
          for fun(Loving game playing is just a bonus!).
