            Whether it's the Sunset Strip, which served as a home, office and
            bar to some of the most famous musicians of all time, or the vibrant
            LGBTQ community that's as ingrained in the community as Rock and
            Roll, West Hollywood seems to add another dimension to its identity
            every couple of years.

            How would you feel if you could change your reality and create a
            whole new one? A reality which is maybe based in space with
            asteroids attacking a spaceship! Or maybe a reality-based in the
            ocean where you try to fight pirates!

            Google “Which filmmakers did film school?” – and you’ll find a long
            list of articles about, and Top 10-lists of filmmakers who never
            went to film school. Is it cooler not to have to go to film school?
            Well, definitely if it strokes your ego to claim you did it all by
            yourselves.
