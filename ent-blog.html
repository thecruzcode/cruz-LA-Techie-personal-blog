          Peter Jackson once said “The more you know, the less you achieve.” He
          is a self-made filmmaker, and claims to have proven you don’t really
          need film school. Google “Which filmmakers did film school?” – and
          you’ll find a long list of articles about, and Top 10-lists of
          filmmakers who never went to film school. Is it cooler not to have to
          go to film school? Well, definitely if it strokes your ego to claim
          you did it all by yourselves.

          Admitted, there are things you cannot learn at school. Like FAILING
          (in the real world), which is probably the most important experience
          you need, to build resilience in an industry as fickle as ours. So,
          then what can you learn? Well, about everything else. I had my first
          teaching experiences in my twenties. I love teaching, and since 2008 I
          have been lecturing and consulting frequently at half a dozen film
          schools, in Australia and internationally. (I also run my own
          screenwriting courses) During this time, I have learned a lot about
          what students do and don’t pick up from my and other courses. I won’t
          look into the cons of going to film school – Peter Jackson took care
          of that. So, instead, let’s look at all the great reasons why you
          should choose a formal film education.

          You will learn the origins of film, and modern filmmaking techniques.
          This will help you adopt principles and practices. Did you know where
          our screenplay format comes from? But sometimes you don’t want to
          reinvent the wheel. It’s great to learn from other people’s mistakes.
          It’s not so smart to make those same errors others have made before
          you – a thousand times over. Why not move to the next stage? Raise the
          bar, and move forward faster! Even if you don’t accept ‘the rules’, an
          awareness of the principles of good storytelling, and successful
          filmmaking will help prepare you to see the light.

          So many students start film school, not really knowing what exactly
          they want to do. This is completely normal. There are so many
          different roles and responsibilities in the world of story
          development, film production, and digital post-production! How can you
          know what you love until you’ve heard about it? Other students can’t
          make up their mind… Do they want to write – or direct? The best way to
          find out, is to just do it. At film school you have nothing to lose.
          You simply step into the shoes of whichever job you’d like to try. By
          emulating the experience, you’ll soon find out for yourself if this is
          what you want to spend your working life doing. Sure you can go on the
          web and Google everything you need to build a career. But others have
          been there before, done the hard work, and facilitated the process for
          you. At film school you get a comprehensive overview of what may
          otherwise seem a daunting underground world of people and systems.
          When you start looking at things with an analytical mind, you will
          find ways to save time, or to do things more simply. This is where
          film school is invaluable. Why would you spend years finding out by
          trial and error, if you can go straight for the kill? If you were to
          hire me directly for advice on pretty much anything, I will charge you
          more than any school pays me. Your share of that fee is absolute
          peanuts, compared to what I would charge you directly. If your film
          school fees seem high, just add up the value of access to people and
          materials. You will soon find out that most film schools are actually
          super cheap.

          I love schools and colleges. They are magical places. Here,
          information doesn’t flow just in one direction. Teachers are learning
          and growing, too. And we don’t all just learn about the craft of
          filmmaking, we learn a lot about each other – and about ourselves.
          Thinking about stories forces you to think about people, and about
          what matters. It helps you see the world in a different way – and
          discover your place in it. Your interaction with your mentors and
          peers will also shape you in a way you never expected. Only a very few
          of us will ever be able to socialise and interact on the same level,
          with as wide and diverse a community as is possible at film school.
          Your workplace will likely be more limited in numbers, and the type of
          people you’ll meet more homogenous. This deep interaction with peers
          and mentors is immensely valuable. You’ll probably draw more
          experience and satisfaction from this, than from any of the classes
          you attend, or the tricks you learn.
